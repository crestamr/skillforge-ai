- ✅ AI Services at http://localhost:8001 with documentation
- ✅ All databases (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis) connected and working

## 🔄 Next Priority Tasks from Plan.md

According to your execution plan, the next section to tackle is **Database Design and Setup**:

### 1. PostgreSQL Database Schema Design
**Priority: HIGH** - This is the foundation for all user data

```bash
# Next prompt to execute:
"Design a comprehensive PostgreSQL database schema for SkillForge AI with the following components:
* Users table with authentication and profile fields
* Skills and UserSkills for skill tracking
* Assessments and UserAssessments for skill evaluation
* LearningPaths and progress tracking
* JobPostings and user interactions
* IndustryTrends for market intelligence
Include proper foreign keys, indexes, and performance optimizations."
```

### 2. Database Migration Scripts
**Priority: HIGH** - Set up the database structure

```bash
# Next prompt to execute:
"Create SQL migration scripts to initialize the PostgreSQL database for SkillForge AI.
Include table creation, enum types, seed data, user roles, and performance optimizations.
Organize migrations in numbered files that can be applied sequentially."
```

### 3. MongoDB Schema Design
**Priority: MEDIUM** - For unstructured data storage

```bash
# Next prompt to execute:
"Design a MongoDB schema for storing unstructured data in SkillForge AI including:
* UserPortfolios for project showcases
* ResumeAnalysis for parsed resume data
* AICoachingConversations for chat history
* MarketIntelligence for trend data
Include validation rules and indexes."
```

## 🎯 Immediate Action Items

### 1. Update Plan.md Progress
Mark the completed tasks in your Plan.md file:
- Change the first 3 items from "COMPLETED" to include checkmarks
- Update any status indicators

### 2. Start Database Design
Execute the database schema design prompts from your Plan.md to establish the data foundation.

### 3. Set Up Development Workflow
```bash
# Daily development commands:
docker-compose -f docker-compose.minimal.yml up -d    # Start services
./scripts/test-minimal-setup.sh                       # Verify everything works
docker-compose -f docker-compose.minimal.yml logs -f  # Monitor logs
```

### 4. Prepare for Database Work
Install database tools for development:
```bash
# PostgreSQL client (if not already installed)
brew install postgresql  # macOS
# or
sudo apt-get install postgresql-client  # Ubuntu

# MongoDB client
brew install mongosh  # macOS
# or
sudo apt-get install mongodb-mongosh  # Ubuntu
```

## 📋 Development Checklist
